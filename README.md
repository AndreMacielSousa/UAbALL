# UAbALL
The "Automata Learning Lab da Universidade Aberta (UAbALL)" strives to be an integrated laboratory for simulation of Automata. A first phase focused on building the base and introducing the Simulation of Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA). This Laboratory intends to enjoy the capacity of extensibility and adaptability, being this document a technical and scientific basis for the future production of the remaining components, as well as adapted to new technological realities and distribution platforms.
During this work, Central Concepts of Automata Theory are used, such as Alphabet (Σ) - Finite set of symbols; String - Finite sequence of symbols chosen from an alphabet; Empty String (ε) - or Empty String; String Length (|𝜔|) - number of elements in the String; String Concatenation (𝑥=011;𝑦=100;𝑥𝑦=011100); Language (𝓛) - set of symbols that obey a property in an Alphabet; Set Builders - for defining Languages, for example { 𝜔 | 𝜔 𝑖𝑠 𝑎 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑟𝑦 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟}..
Chapter 1 consists of the formal presentation of the project, outlining the objectives and presenting the work plan.
For the second Chapter, the design process was reserved, with respective specifications and drawings, from the application of languages, through menus, global functionalities, graphical interface, discussion and decision of the environment, plus the definition of resources.
Chapter 3 is dedicated to the implementation of the themes and approaches addressed in the former chapter, concluding with tests on the application and discussion regarding the results achieved.
Before the presentation concerning the conclusions, version 0.1 of the laboratory is made available, and the plan for monitoring new versions is outlined.
All code resulting from this project is attached to the end of this project manual, which indicates the technical report for future work.
Keywords: Finite Automota, Regular Expressions and Languages, Context-Free Grammars and Languages, Turing Machines.
